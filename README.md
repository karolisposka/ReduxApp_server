# E-Commerce project (Redux-toolkit)

This is my first big scale React-Redux  e-commerce project. Not everything works silky smooth, however a lot of lessons has been learned.

Back-end is running on Node.js server. For data storing mysql database has been use, while users authorization implemented with JWT token.

Website is currently deployed. If you are intrested please do not hesitate to test it!
